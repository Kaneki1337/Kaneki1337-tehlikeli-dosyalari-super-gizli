# Discord WebHook Information

**This Discord tool allows you to get some information from a Discord webhook, you only have to paste the webhook and it shows you the ID of the channel and that of the server
where the webhook is and it also shows you the webhook name and profile image url.
You have not to download any Python module because they are only downloaded in the code if you have not them (dhooks and colorama).**
